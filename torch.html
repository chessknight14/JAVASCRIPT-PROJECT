        <h1> Minecraft: Spawning </h1>
        <p> 
            Mobs spawn in various ways. Most mobs spawn naturally, depending on the light level, biome, and their
            surroundings. For example, most animals are found in bright areas on the surface, while hostile monsters
            are commonly found in the dark (whether it's a cave, monster room, mansion, or at night). Animals
            usually spawn upon chunk generation, while hostile monsters spawn and despawn in a certain radius
            around the player. <br>

            Most mobs never spawn on transparent blocks, in water (except fish, dolphins, turtles, and other
            aquatic creatures), in lava (except for striders), on bedrock, or on blocks less than a full block
            tall (such as slabs placed on the bottom half). The exception is monster spawners, from which
            monsters can spawn naturally on any block including air. 
        </p>

        <h1> Minecraft: Behaviour</h1>
        <p>
            Mobs are affected by the environment in the same ways as the player; they are subject to physics,
            and they can be hurt by the same things that harm the player (catching on fire, falling, drowning,
            attacks from weapons, the /kill command, etc.). Some mobs may be resistant or immune to certain
            hazards, such as some Nether mobs, which are immune to fire. All aquatic mobs except dolphins
            are immune to drowning. Mobs can ride minecarts and other mobs can climb up ladders. When
            mobs are killed, they turn to smoke particles and drop items that may be useful resources. <br><br>

            Each type of mob in Minecraft has a certain AI (artificial intelligence) system with different
            behaviors and mechanics. Mobs ordinarily wander around at random if there is a player within
            32 blocks and usually avoid walking off blocks high enough to cause falling damage. Many mobs
            have an advanced path-finding system that allows them to navigate through obstacles to get
            to a desired object or destination. <br> Passive mobs flee in random directions after being hurt,
            while hostile mobs face and chase/attack the player as soon as the player comes close.
            Neutral mobs remain neutral until a player or mob provokes it (usually by attacking),
            at which point the neutral mob becomes hostile toward and attacks the entity that hit
            it. Most mobs are aware of players within (a Euclidian distance) 16 blocks of them,
            but some can see farther. Conversely, most mobs can be heard by players up to 16
            blocks away. Mobs are harmless to players in Creative mode.
